# ColorFight! AI and Accelerated Testing Server by Petry!

## ColorFight 

ColorFight is a game where you try to occupy as many cells as possible on the map.

### Rules

* When you join the game, you will be given a random cell as a start, this cell will be your first base.

* You can only attack the cell that's adjacent to your occupied cells.

* You can only attack one cell at a time. During that time, you are not able to attack other cells.

* The time you need to occupy a cell is based on the last time when the cell is occupied. The longer the time is, the easier it would be to be attacked. The minimum time to occupy a cell is 2s. (The equation of the time to occupy is ```2 + 20 * (2 ^ (-x/20))```. So when it's just occupied, it takes 22s to attack it. After 20s, it becomes 12s. After around 55s, it becomes 5s). If the cell is surrounded by more than 1 attacker's occupied cell, the time to take it is decreased. One extra adjacent cell takes off 25% to take the cell.

* You can attack your own cell to refresh the occupy time, but it would take the same amount of time as other players attacking it.

* Golden cells worth 5 times as normal cells.

### How To Start
=======
* Your energy will accumulate 1 per second per energy cell you occupied. The maximum energy is 100.

* The time to take a cell will be divided by (1 + energy/100).

* Attacking other player's cell will cost you 5% of current energy.

* When your base cell is occupied by other players, one of your cells that's adjacent to it will become the base. If there's no adjacent cells that's occupied by you, the base will disappear.

* If you lose all your bases, you will lose immediately. All your cells will become empty cells.

* You can build a base on any cell that you occupy using 60 energy. Building a base takes 30s and each player can only have 3 bases. You can't build a base if you are currently building one.

* You have two active skills to use your energy. You can either boost you attack speed or do a multiple attack/defense.

## How To Start
>>>>>>> c1fd50644eca6641b6385847673731b729b5e5c5

* First clone the git repository. `git clone https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/ColorFightAI.git`

* Then you can run the exampleAI by `python exampleAI.py`

* If your computer complains about `requests` module, try `pip install requests[security]` or `sudo pip install requests[security]` if it complains about privilege. 

* Or you can use python3 by `python3 exampleAI.py`. The library and the exampleAI support both python2 and python3. 

* You can watch the result here [https://colorfight.herokuapp.com/](https://colorfight.herokuapp.com)

### API

The module provided some API for the game. You are welcome to add your own API, even directly talk to the server with HTTP requests if you want.

`Game` is the main class for the API. You should instantiate an object for it like `g = Game()`.

#### After that, you can do the following actions:

* `JoinGame(name)` will let you join the game with a name. ex. `g.JoinGame('MyAI')`. Notice the API is already optimized so when you try to join the game with the same name on the same computer(with the generated token file), it will not generate a user. You can continue to play the game as the user before. `name` has to be a `str`.

* `Refresh()` will get the current game data from the server. ex. `g.Refresh()`. This function will store the raw data into `self.data` which you can access if you want. Also this function will fill in `self.width` and `self.height` for the game, as well as `self.currTime` for the time of this information. For game that has a end time, `self.endTime` will be updated, otherwise it will be `0`.

* `GetCell(x,y)` is an easy way to access the data of one cell. ex. `g.GetCell(1,2)`. The function will return a `Cell` object which has all the data of a single cell at (x,y). If the pair (x,y) given is invalid, it will return `None`. x and y starts with `0`, and the maximum value is `g.width-1`, `g.height-1`, respectively.

* `AttackCell(x,y,boost=False)`is the attack action you need to play the game. ex. `g.AttackCell(2,2)`. It will try to attack the cell you specified. `boost` argument is `False` by default. If you set that to `True`, it will try to use 10 energy to boost the attack, which means it will take 2 seconds to occupy the cell regardless of how long the cell is occupied. If you don't have enough energy, the action will fail. The return value will be a tuple with 3 items. Returning `(True, None, None)` means the action is successful. Otherwise it will return a tuple `(False, err_code, err_msg)` where `err_code` will contain the error code from the server and `err_msg` will contain the reason it failed.

* `BuildBase(x,y)` is the action to build a new base. ex. `g.BuildBase(3,3)`. It will try to build a base on the cell you specified. The return value is similar to `AttackCell()`.

* `Boom(x,y,direction,boomType)` is a multi attack/defense skill you can use if you have enough energy. `direction` should be either `"square"` or `"vertical"` or `"horizontal"`. `direction` defines how the multi operation will be take effect. `"square"` means around the cell you specified(a 3x3 square). `"vertical"` means 4 cells on both the top and bottom of the cell you specified(a 1x9 vertical line). `"horizontal"` means 4 cells on both the left and right of the cell you specified(a 9x1 horizontal line). `boomType` should be either `"attack"` or `"defense"`. `"attack"` takes 1 second and 30 energy and make all the cells you choose(excluding your specified cell) empty(no owners). Also `"attack"` needs to be used on the cell that you own. `"defense"` takes 2 second and 50 energy and makes all the cells you choose(including your specified cell) that owned by you refresh(like you just occupy them). You can apply this skill to any cell you want but it will only refresh your cells in the range.

#### You also have the following data in `Game`:

* `uid` contains your user id. That's the unique identification for you.

* `endTime` is the time when the current game will end. If it's `0`, it's unlimited time game. This is a timestamp from the server.

* `width` and `height` contains the width and height of the current game.

* `currTime` is the current time of the current data from the server. This is a timestamp from the server.

* `users` is a list of `User` object which has all the user info.

* `cdTime` is your cd time

* `cellNum` is your cell number

### Cell Data

* `owner`: who owns this cell now. It's a user id.

* `attacker`: who is attacking this cell now. Invalid if `isTaking` is `False`.

* `isTaking`: is this cell being attacked. If it's `True` then you can't attack it.

* `x`: x coordinate.

* `y`: y coordinate.

* `occupyTime`: when is this cell occupied. Server side time in seconds. This is a timestamp from the server.

* `attackTime`: when is this cell attacked. Invalid if `isTaking` is `False`. This is a timestamp from the server.

* `takeTime`: how long it would take if you attack this cell. This is a number of seconds.

* `finishTime`: when will the attack finish. Invalid if `isTaking` is `False`. This is a timestamp from the server.

* `cellType`: `'gold'` if it's a golden cell, 'energy' if it's a energy cell and `'normal'` if it's a normal cell.`

* `isBase`: if it's a base of the player.

* `isBuilding`: if there's a base being built on the cell.

* `buildTime`: when is the base built on this cell. If it's `0`, it means no base is currently be built on the cell.

### User Data

* `id`: unique user identification.

* `name`: user name.

* `cdTime`: when can this user attack again. This is a timestamp from the server.

* `cellNum`: how many cells does this user occupy.

### Error Code from AttackCell()
=======
* `energy`: hou much energy does this user have.
